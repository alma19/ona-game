# ona-game

This is a quiz I created for ONA17's Student Newsroom that allows participants to play around with how much it could cost to attend ONA.

Built using Daniel Stern's  [Choose Your Own](https://github.com/danielstern/cyoChoose) plugin.

Currently working on heavily cleaning up and refactoring this code, as it was built in about a day. Thanks!
